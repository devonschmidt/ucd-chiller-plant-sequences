Upon start up, the flow setpoint shall be 4,500 gpm. 

If the active differential pressure is > DP SP + 2, decrease flow setpoint by 100 gpm every adjustable interval (3 minutes). 

If the active differential pressure is < DP SP + 1, increase flow setpoint by 100 gpm every adjustable interval (3 minutes).

Min: Number of active chillers * x minimum flow (2,000 gpm)

Max: The setpoint is a rolling average of the chiller flow rates (FIT2150 + FIT2350 + FIT3150 + FIT3350)
