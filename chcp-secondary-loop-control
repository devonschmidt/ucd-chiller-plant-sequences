Upon start up, the flow setpoint shall be 4,500 gpm. 

If the transmitter with the greatest deviation from setpoint has a deviation greater than 2 PSID, decrease flow setpoint by 100 gpm every 3 minutes. 

If the transmitter with the greatest deviation between setpoint and value among active campus DP transmitters is less than -2 PSID, increase flow setpoint by 100 gpm every 3 minutes

Min: Number of active chillers * x minimum flow (2,000 gpm)

Max: The setpoint is a rolling average of the chiller flow rates (FIT2150 + FIT2350 + FIT3150 + FIT3350)
